  To start our game, the user will be asked several choices.
  First, our programm allows the user to choose the board, one is 3*3*3, and the other is 6*7*4;
  And then, the user can choose the opponent: An AI uses random choices; An AI uses MINIMAX; An AI uses MINIMAX with alpha-beta pruning; An AI uses H-MINIMAX.
  Next is to choose whether to play first or second.
  If the user chooses H-MINIMAX, he/she will be asked to select a cut-off depth.
